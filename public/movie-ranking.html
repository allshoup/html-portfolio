<h3>1. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>A masterclass in the middle-child of trilogies. The introduction to the Ents and the dialogue of the Urukai is unmatched.</p>

<h3>2. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>"Mountains, Gandelf, mountains!"</p>
<br>
<h3>3. The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</h3>
<p>Aragorn's speech at the Black Gate. Enough said.</p>
